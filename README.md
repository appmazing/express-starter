## Is this universal?

 You can checkout any client side starter kit to `client` directory or use our universal React/Redux starter.
 To learn more check `client/README.md`

## What is making difference in this starter kit?

 - unopinionated structure
 - as minimal amount of magic as it's possible...
 - ...yet still doing a lot of work for you
 - lot of comments instead of documentation of complicated magic methods
 - list of libraries/packages used in framework with resources to learn about them more
